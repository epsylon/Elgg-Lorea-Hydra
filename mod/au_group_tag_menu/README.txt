Group tag menu
=========================

Allows tags to be shown as menu items in groups. 

Will automatically show top tags (number configurable by the group owner) or,
alternatively, the owner may enter tags which may or may not exist yet, which
will appear as a menu in the order entered.
Clicking a tag will show a listing of posts from the group that match the
selected tag, displayed within that group, not as a search listing.
Also provides a group tag cloud - clicking a tag will list results within the
group itself, rather than in a search context.

Admin may choose whether or not this tag menu is shown by default for all groups.
