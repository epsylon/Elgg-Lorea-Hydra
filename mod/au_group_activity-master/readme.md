Group Activity Plus
====================

Adds four tabs to the group activity tool:
- Activities in the group (as per the default, but with added object type selection option)
- Member activities across the site (not just in the group)
- Per-member activity stats (with various statistics such as join date, number of posts, first post, last post, etc. Has search filter to cater for larger group sizes)
- Group stats (number of members, posts per object type, most recent activity, etc)
Site admins can always see the stats tabs but can choose whether to show them to others.
Group admins can control whether or not the stat tabs are shown to other users.

Produced for and on behalf of Athabasca University.
