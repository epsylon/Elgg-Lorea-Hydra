Group default access
-----------------------
As of version 2.3 of this plugin we offer the ability to set a group default access level (like with Site and User), 
this will however not work if you haven't applied https://github.com/Elgg/Elgg/pull/253 to your Elgg installation.

This fix is in place for Elgg 1.9, so no modifications will be needed to the Elgg core files.
