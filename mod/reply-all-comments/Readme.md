Elgg Reply-All Comments
=======================

Normally, when commenting on an object (blog, file etc), comment notifications are only sent to the original creator of the entity.

This tiny plugin modifies that behaviour, and now comment notifications are sent to all those who have commented on the entity as well as the creator (but not to yourself).

Installation
------------

 * Install the plugin into your /mod directory and activate it.
